# CTD AI Notebooks
This repo contains multiple notebooks to introduce core skills that we hope to ultimately incorporate into the course. The modular design ensures flexibility, allowing us to adapt, add, or remix content as tools evolve. Some notebooks will incorporate many of these tools into larger-scale projects.

This is all a WIP and subject to change. 

## Modular toolkit
These are the draft notebooks that introduce key tools, ideas, and mental models. The first few are intended to be taught in order. Others can be slotted in as needed. 

> Some of the following are just stubs, some are more developed but have significant TODO's

| Notebook Name         | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `01_hello_ai`         | Set up the OpenAI API, securely store your API key, and test it by generating a response using `gpt-4o-mini`. A friendly "hello world" for AI. |
| `02_prompts_to_chats` | Learn the basics of prompt engineering and role-based message formatting. Ends with building a simple chatbot using the OpenAI API. |
| `embeddings_intro`    | Visualize and explore text embeddings using PCA and cosine similarity. An intro to how LLMs represent meaning. |
| `ollama_intro`        | Install the Ollama server and run large language models locally on your machine without needing an external API. |
| `huggingface_intro`   | Get started with Hugging Face tools, models, and datasets. Learn how to use them locally or in the cloud. |
| `langchain_intro`     | Learn the basics of LangChain and how to use it to build more complex, modular LLM-powered applications. |

## Projects
These are more than just modular intros â€” they start to combine tools and ideas. These will ideally give students a taste of how real-world LLM applications work, and provide the basis for more practical applications.

> The following are just stubs with no content

| Notebook Name         | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `rag_intro`           | Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Use when your AI needs access to external knowledge or documents. |
| `agents_intro`        | When your AI needs to *do* things, not just *say* things. Learn about agents that can act autonomously via tools and software. |

## To do
- Consider what notebooks are missing? Are there any we should cut?
