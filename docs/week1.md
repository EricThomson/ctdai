# Week 1: Introduction to Generative AI and LLMs
Week 1 introduces students to generative AI, with a focus on large language models (LLMs). We will cover foundational concepts in modern NLP, how transformer-based models work, and how to use commercially available APIs such as OpenAI's. The week ends with students building their own chatbot interface and exploring basic LangChain and Ollama functionality.

## Focus
- General background
    - How do LLMs fit into the wider ML/AI landscape.
    - What happened? Why was there an LLM explosion (attention/transormer architecture etc).
    - Pretraining vs fine-tuning
- Working with APIs 
    - Working with OpenAI api (chat models vs completion models)
    - Understanding input/output formats (system/user/assistant roles)
    - Parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc) 
- Prompt engineering
    - Zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought prompting.
    - Prompt templates  
- Build a basic chatbot interface
- Ollama: running models locally
- Langchain intro
    - What it does, when to use it
    - Running different models
    - LCEL (langchain expression language)
    - Interfacing Ollama with langchain
  
## Hands-On Activities
- Learn the basics of the OpenAI API:
- Use LangChain to load an LLM and build a basic prompt chain
- Compare a plain OpenAI call vs. LangChain wrapper
- Run a model via Ollama and access it from LangChain

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this week, students will be able to:

- Explain what LLMs are and how they differ from earlier NLP models, and why they have become so much more powerful recently. 
- Use OpenAIâ€™s API to send prompts and interpret responses
- Apply basic prompt engineering principles to improve model output
- Build a basic chatbot interface using an LLM
- Understand what LangChain is and how it interfaces with LLMs (abstraction layer to interface with multiple LLMs)
- Run and query a local LLM using Ollama
