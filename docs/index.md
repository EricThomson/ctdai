# Code the Dream AI Course Development
A workspace to develop hands-on, accessible AI teaching materials for [Code the Dream](https://codethedream.org/). This informal space is to experiment with lesson plans, identify the most important skills, and create learning paths for the AI bits in Python 200. Student facing-material will ultimately be part of the full Python 200 course at Code the Dream. 

## Background and motivation
AI has become a huge field that could easily cover a year of material. In Python 200, we have three weeks, and will focus in on a few core topics: 

- [Week 1: Intro to LLMs](week1.md): From large-language-models to chatbots.
- [Week 2: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](week2.md): Supplementing AI with external knowledge bases.
- [Week 3: Agents](week3.md): Giving AI systems the ability to plan and use external tools.
