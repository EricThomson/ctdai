# CTD LLM Dev Docs
A workspace to develop hands-on, accessible LLM teaching materials for [Code the Dream](https://codethedream.org/). This informal space is to experiment with lesson plans, identify the most important skills, and create learning paths for Python 200. Student facing-material will ultimately be hosted separately at Code the Dream. 

## Background and motivation
Generative AI (specifically focused on LLMs) is a huge field that could easily cover a year of material. In Python 200, we have three weeks, and will focus in on a few core topics. After giving a general introduction to generative AI and LLMs in Week 1, we will dive into more specific topics. For more details about the plan for a given week, please click on the link.

- [Week 1: Hello AI](week1.md): From large-language-models to chatbots.
- [Week 2: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](week2.md): Building external knowledge-sources into LLM applications. 
- [Week 3: Agents](week3.md): Giving AI systems the ability to plan and use external tools.
