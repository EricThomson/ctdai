# CTD LLM Dev Docs
A workspace to develop hands-on, accessible LLM teaching materials for [Code the Dream](https://codethedream.org/). This informal space is to experiment with lesson plans, identify the most important skills, and create learning paths for Python 200. Student facing-material will ultimately be hosted separately at Code the Dream. 

## Background and motivation
Generative AI (specifically focused on LLMs) is a huge field that could easily cover a year of material. In Python 200, we have three weeks, so we need to focus on a few key topics to give students a sense for how to do effective prompt generation with chatbot engineering, build LLMs that depend on custom knowledge stores, and finally, introduce them to the world of agents. 

## Main Workflows
After giving a general introduction to generative ai and LLMs in Week 1, we will dive into more specific topics. 

- [Week 1: Hello AI](week1.md): From large-language-models to chatbots.
- [Week 2: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](week2.md): Building external knowledge-sources into LLM applications. 
- [Week 3: Agents](week3.md): Giving AI systems the ability to plan and use external tools.
