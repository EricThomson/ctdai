# Code the Dream AI Workspace
A workspace to develop hands-on, accessible AI teaching materials for [Code the Dream](https://codethedream.org/). This informal space is for experimenting with lesson plans, identifying core skills, and creating learning paths for Python 200 and AI modules. Student facing-material will be hosted at Code the Dream. 

## Plan
AI has become a huge field that could easily cover a year of material. In Python 200, we have three weeks, and will focus in on a few core topics: 

- **Week 1: Intro to LLMs**: From large-language-models to chatbots.
- **Week 2: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**: Building external knowledge-sources into LLM applications. 
- **Week 3: Agents**: Giving AI systems the ability to plan and use external tools.

For a much more detailed discussion for each week, please [see the docs](https://ctdai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

We are also building different [notebooks/](notebooks/README.md) to drop code for acquiring different skills and tools. Many of these are placeholders as we figure out the trajectory/learning path.
